# Introduction

Emergence is a way to build cloud software for organizations that aims to shift the focus from managing constellations of individual apps/services to managing a complete environment that truely belongs to and evolves with the organization.

Emergence is _not_ for building systems with ambitions of global scale. It is optimized for building, sharing, re-using, and extending systems in spaces where scaling means a global community of peer organizations getting to own their own systems and control their own futures while still benefiting from sharing an ecosystem of common starting points and additions.
