# Get Hosting

No one is setup to sell managed hosting for individual app instances.

There are some organizations you can apply to though for hosting projects in the public interest:

- Slate Foundation
- Code for Philly
- Jarvus Innovation

Your best bet is to just rent a commodity cloud virtual machine and install the emergence kernel yourself. The most basic virtual machines cost around $5/month, and could host any number of apps without serious traffic.
